        <p>In plants, bacteria and yeast, phosphate is important for cell growth and helps cells to communicate and generate energy.
            While it is known to be essential in animal tissues and cells, few studies had explored its specific functions.
            Charles Xu, a geneticist at the Rockefeller University in New York City,
            was curious what role phosphate played in regulating tissue renewal in the fruit fly gut, 
             useful model for studying how diseases affect cells in the human intestine.
             “That’s not really well known, especially in animal cells,” says Xu</p>

                    To find out how phosphate was having this effect, Xu and his team investigated whether low phosphate levels affected gene expression.
                    A gene that the authors call PXo is similar to a mammalian gene that encodes a phosphate-sensing protein.
                    Xu and colleagues found that PXo's expression was weaker when cells were deprived of phosphate.
                    This reduced gene expression also kicked cell division into overdrive. However,
                    cell division slowed down when the researchers tweaked the gene to overexpress the PXo protein.</p>

                    <p>When the fly cells were deprived of phosphate, the organelles broke apart and released the stored phospholipids into each cell,
                        indicating that they function like reservoirs, says Xu. This breakdown activated cellular machinery known as Cka,
                        triggering a stress signal that increased the production of new cells.
                        This could be a way for the intestinal lining to keep phosphate levels stable,
                        because the increased number of cells can absorb more of the nutrient, says Xu.
                        “It’s beneficial for the organism to regenerate more of these healthy [cells],” he says.</p>

                The discovery of a new organelle in animal cells also highlights how much there is still to learn about cell physiology, adds Xu.
                "The beauty is there, it's just waiting for us to discover it," he says.
