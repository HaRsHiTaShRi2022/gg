            <p>Summer- when I think of summer, I think back to summer vacation! 
                When endless Summer’s seemed possible and you run around having fun
                 after working so hard during the school year, but you know what else 
                 I remember about summer? Storms! Especially living in Florida.
                 If we weren’t careful and didn’t prepare for storms,
                 we would get caught in them and all the stuff we had planned to do,
                 ran the chance of getting ruined. This is the same for us now.
                 Summer is a time of growth. We’ve planted the seeds and now we learn to protect them and grow them even as the storms of life come
                 Because we’ve been settled in certain areas of our lives, we know that storms will come… Often times sent by the enemy,
                 but God allows them to see how we have prepared for the next season…this season is crucial… It can make us or break us,
                 But if you learn to thrive during this time it can be the most productive time of your life.<br><em>bander kai maje</em>
